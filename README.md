## auto-reload-brunch
Adds automatic browser reloading support to
[brunch](http://brunch.io).

The plugin uses WebSocket technology to pass `compile` events to browser.

## Usage
Add `"auto-reload-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.

Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.

If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"auto-reload-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/auto-reload-brunch.git"`.

Because auto reload is often used only for html / style development
(because for scripts it would most of the time be quite annoying),
by default plugin is disabled. You can enable it by adding a simple script
to your page.


	<script>
  		window.brunch = window.brunch || {};
  		window.brunch['auto-reload'] = {enabled: true};
	</script>

**Note:** this snippet must be added **before** the other scripts on the page.
